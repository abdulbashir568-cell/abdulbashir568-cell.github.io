                        main export sectors, employing over a million people, mostly rural women. The industry is known
                        for its vibrant colors, intricate designs such as the “elephant’s foot,” and high-quality
                        natural materials. Despite challenges like poverty, market competition, and restrictions on
                        women, efforts continue to increase production and supply for global markets, especially China.

                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the
                    web. It acts as the skeleton of a webpage, using tags to define elements like text, images, and
                    links. HTML is based on hypertext (connecting pages through links) and markup (using tags to
                    describe structure). Each element includes a start tag, content, and an end tag—except for
                    self-closing tags like or Attributes inside tags provide extra information, such as image sources or
                    link destinations.</p>

                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to control the visual appearance of web pages
                    by defining colors, fonts, layouts, spacing, and animations. While HTML provides the structure of a
                    webpage, CSS makes it look attractive and organized by applying design rules through selectors. It
                    allows developers to create responsive designs that work on all devices, and it is essential for
                    building modern, visually appealing websites.</p>

                <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
                <p>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level programming language that brings interactivity and dynamic behavior
                    to websites. It allows web pages to respond to user actions, update content without reloading,
                    create animations, validate forms, and build modern web applications. JavaScript works directly
                    inside the browser and can also run on servers through Node.js, making it one of the most important
                    and widely used languages in web development.</p>

                <h2>NODE.JS</h2>
                <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to
                    run JavaScript outside the browser, mainly on the server side. Built on Google Chrome’s
                    high-performance V8 engine, it uses an event-driven, non-blocking architecture that makes it
                    extremely fast and efficient for handling many simultaneous requests. With access to npm (Node
                    Package Manager), Node.js supports millions of reusable packages, making it ideal for building APIs,
                    real-time applications like chats, streaming services, and scalable backend systems.</p>

                name via an internet browser. Its main components include web pages (HTML documents), a domain name
                (site address), web hosting (where files are stored), a URL (specific page address), a homepage (main
                starting page), navigation menus, and content such as text, images, and videos. Websites can be static
                with fixed content or dynamic with content that updates based on user actions or databases. They also
                come in different types, including e-commerce sites, blogs, social media platforms, informational sites,
                portfolios, and business websites. When a user enters a URL, the browser sends a request to the server,
                the server processes it and returns the files, and the browser displays the website.</p>

            regions such as Balkh, Jowzjan, Helmand, Kandahar, and Nangarhar, where it is used for clothing, bedding,
            medical supplies, cottonseed oil, and as the strong warp and weft threads that form the foundation of Afghan
            handmade carpets, ensuring durability and long life. Sesame sweet (sesame halva) is a well-known traditional
            food made from locally grown sesame seeds mixed with sugar or honey; it is rich in energy, healthy oils,
            protein, calcium, and iron, and is commonly eaten with bread and tea, particularly during winter and
            religious or family gatherings. Afghan carpets, handwoven using centuries-old techniques, usually combine
            cotton bases with high-quality wool piles and natural dyes, feature symbolic geometric and floral designs
            that represent regional identity, and play a major role in providing employment, preserving cultural
            heritage, and generating income through domestic sales and exports, making these three products deeply
            interconnected and vital to Afghanistan’s traditional economy and daily life.</p>

                <h2>Grap</h2>
                <p>Grapes are an important crop in Aqcha, Jawzjan province, northern Afghanistan, where they are grown
                    by many local farmers using mostly traditional methods. The region produces both fresh grapes and
                    raisins, which are harvested in late summer and early autumn, providing significant income for rural
                    families. Raisin production helps reduce post-harvest losses and allows farmers to sell their
                    produce at higher value, while women often participate in vineyard care, harvesting, and drying.
                    Despite challenges like water scarcity and reliance on traditional irrigation, local programs and
                    small infrastructure projects have supported farmers with training in grape cultivation, processing,
                    and storage, improving quality and market opportunities for this vital agricultural product.</p>

                <h2>Butcher</h2>
                <p>In Aqcha district of Jawzjan province, Afghanistan, the role of a butcher (قصاب) is tied closely to
                    local livestock and meat supply, and traditionally butchers buy animals from livestock markets or
                    directly from herders, slaughter them, and sell fresh meat to the community, often using basic tools
                    and methods with limited formal infrastructure or regulation. Recently, local authorities began
                    building a proper slaughterhouse (killing/processing facility) in Aqcha to improve hygiene, prevent
                    unsafe home slaughtering, and ensure healthier, inspected meat for sale, which reflects efforts to
                    standardize meat processing and reduce health risks from casual slaughter practices. However, some
                    local butchers have expressed concerns that moving to a centralized facility increases transport
                    costs and work compared with traditional home slaughtering.</p>

                <h2>Grap</h2>
                <p>In Aqcha, Jawzjan province (northern Afghanistan), melons are a major seasonal crop that farmers grow
                    extensively on irrigated land and harvest in the summer–early autumn, providing both food and income
                    for local communities; Jawzjan alone produced over 116,000 tonnes of melons in a recent season, but
                    many growers struggle with low market prices and limited buyers, which can make it hard to recoup
                    their costs. Melons from this region are known for their sweetness and quality and are sold locally
                    and in neighboring provinces, and cultural events like melon festivals in nearby Sheberghan
                    celebrate dozens of melon varieties grown across the area, showcasing their agricultural importance
                    to the province. Afghanistan overall harvested more than 1.35 million tons of melons in a recent
                    year, with Jawzjan among the top producing provinces.</p>

        <h1>MORE-INFOMATION AGRICULTURE</h1>
        <p>Aqcha district in Jawzjan province is an agricultural hub where fruit cultivation and livestock farming are
            vital for local livelihoods. Melons are a major seasonal crop, harvested in summer and early autumn, with
            the province producing over 116,000 tonnes recently; they are prized for their sweetness and quality, sold
            locally and in neighboring provinces, though farmers face challenges like low prices, limited buyers, and
            water scarcity, prompting initiatives for better seeds, irrigation, and market access. Grapes are also
            widely grown, often by small-scale farmers, and are processed into raisins to increase shelf life and
            income, with women frequently participating in vineyard care, harvesting, and drying. In addition, livestock
            and butchers are essential to the community, as many families raise sheep, goats, and cows; local butchers
            traditionally purchase animals from markets or herders, slaughter them, and sell fresh meat, while emerging
            infrastructure like centralized slaughterhouses improves hygiene, ensures safer meat, and creates better
            market opportunities. Together, these agricultural and livestock activities form the backbone of Aqcha’s
            rural economy, supporting thousands of families and reflecting a mix of traditional practices and gradual
            modernization.</p>
